# Fragility
Fragility module for RAVE

This is an implementation of Li et al's [neural fragility](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00901-w) biomarker of the epileptogenic zone within the RAVE environment. The eventual goal is to make computationally complex iEEG biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone such as neural fragility more accessible to epilepsy surgery programs and researchers.

RAVE is a powerful, free, open-source, NIH-funded research tool designed to analyze and visualize iEEG data that allows users to code their own modules for custom analyses. All information about RAVE can be found on [the RAVE website](https://rave.wiki).
